Pulls episodes from J-Archive and reads the clues and answers one at a time

Check the 'releases' tab to download the compiled game.

To start a game, run 'start game.bat' and type in the ID for the game you want to play (the numbers at the end of the URL for the game, right after where it says 'game_id='. Do not enter the number of the game itself). So for instance, if you wanted to play the episode that aired on September 4, 2000, the url for which is:</br>
http://www.j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=1789</br>
After you run the .bat file, you would type in "1789" and hit enter.

If you just want to start from the beginning of the game, just ignore the next four prompts and hit enter 3 more times to start the game. 

If you want to resume a game from where you left off, for the round answer J for single jeopardy or DJ for double jeopardy. For the column and row, just enter the numbers of the column and row you left off at. So, for instance, if you wanted to pick up a game that you left off in the double jeopardy round in category 3 and row 2, you would enter:</br>
DJ</br>
3</br>
2</br>

If you want to pause a game, just hit the space bar, and hit it again when you want to resume.
